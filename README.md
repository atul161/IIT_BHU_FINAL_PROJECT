                           DESCRIPTION
                           
Natural disaster is one thing which is beyond the 
control of human beings,
but basically we are responsible for all these
calamitites. Because we are harming our

Now-a-days our country is facing many natural
disaster. Natural disaster affects the livelihood 
very badly, it takes a lot of time
to people to recover from it. There is also 
need to aware people about the safety measures
to be taken during any natural disaster.
It also affects the economy of the country. 
Recently Kerala had suffered a lot due to
flood. Many campaigns were organised by government 
and private institutions to donate for Kearla.
We are donating to government
and NGOs which took a lot of time to send relief
material to needy ones.

to make an app through which  needy ones can directly
contact with donater. It is 
basically to be used by affected people 
after the calamity is gone.
